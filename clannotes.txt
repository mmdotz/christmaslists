What is a clan: A group of users by name
JOIN table?

User Model
belongs_to :users, dependent => :destroy


fields:
name
FK user_id

considerations:
users will want to see a list of other users by clan clan.users
user can belong_to more than one clan - read about this relationship
would we need to see current_user.clans for any reason?
seed
