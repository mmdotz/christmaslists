What is a Purchase: any gift, physical or financial

Purchase Model
belongs_to :user, dependent => :destroy

fields:
item
url
vendor
total cost :integer
tracking number :string
bought :boolean
FK user_id


considerations:
not all fields should be required so cash gifts can be saved
ideally this would be tied to Wish List
want to see recipient.purchases
?? do purchases belong_to a season?
